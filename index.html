The app allows users to track dirty and clean clothes by selecting items as 'worn', or 'washed'.</p>
            <p>This app was completed by a team of six students. While I helped work on all parts of the project, my main contribution was the integration layer. I used a Node.js framework that displayed MySQL database information in pug templates.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-5">Interests</h2>

        <p>Two of my biggest interests are sports and the outdoors. I like to hike, and I also run on trails when the weather permits. I love to ski and go up to the mountains every chance I get. Being able to ski on some of the best mountains in the country was a big factor when choosing to go to school in Boulder. I also really enjoy golfing and try to play as often as I can. I've found that it's a great stress reliever and discipline. Outside the activities, I love to watch sports. I follow the NFL and NBA all year, and am a huge Seattle Seahawks and Golden State Warriors fan. Another interest of mine is reading. I've gone through a wide variety of books throughout my life but have picked up a fascination with philosophy reading during my time at CU. I'm naturally drawn to anything that makes me think and I've found that philosophy is a great tool for that. Working with kids is also a passion of mine. I really enjoy the process of passing on the knowledge that I have, which was something I was able to do while coaching soccer both early in college and in high school.</p>
